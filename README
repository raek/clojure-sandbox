This is a congloremate of various small projects I'm working on.

* xmlns -- add XML Namespaces support on top of clojure.xml
* watcher-frame -- display the value of a reference in a window
* xml-tree-view -- draw a view of an XML tree (barely begun coding)

Take a look in the "examples" directory for examples.
